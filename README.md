# Horiseon Marketing page

## Description
This challenge was all about getting the Horiseon Marketing webpage to fuction correctly and follow html semantic format. During this challenge I was able to learn how links work and why its so important to use different id's to call different parts of your webpage. I fixed one nav link that was not responding when it was clicked on, by creating an id for it and using that to link them together. I also created the proper header, body, and footer to make the overall structure more semantic. I also provied alt attributes to make more user friendly and meet accessibility standards
